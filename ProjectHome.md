# Atatonic CSS Framework #
This is the project page for the Atatonic CSS Framework. Atatonic is designed to make my developers life a bit easier. I created this framework out of my experience as a front-end developer and I tried to incorporate as much best practices as possible.

Lately there are more and more CSS frameworks popping out of ground. My issue with most of them is that they mainly focus on the grid. All the other options are added in later. This framework has it's main focus on typography. Vertical rhythm is one of the most important things in design, so why not start your perspective from that angle?

To make my life easier as a developer I added grid support in the Atatonic CSS Framework. It's works like any other grid system, but with only about 10 lines of CSS.

The main goal of this project is to provide a solid base to start with every project. I do not want to bloat this framework with features. That is what you do in the project specific styles. The combined file is only 5kb. Deflate or gzip it and you are down to 3kb.

The Atatonic CSS Framework is still very young. It is a basic set-up of typography and grid tools. Changes will be made and things will be added in the process. I aim to keep the core lean and mean. Extra features will be added as plugins. Like a stylesheet for forms or something that adds extra typographical features.

Feature plans for plugins include icons for buttons, better form controls and maybe some GUI standards such as dialogs, bars, buttons and more.ï»¿
